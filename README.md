# cmake-embed
A cmake module to embed files into your project easily using, well... cmake!

--TODO--

Usage: embed_file("res/picture.png")

Its that easy, it will compile a bit eater to take the picture and spit out a header with its information, as well as its name.
Ex: res/picture.png -> res/picture.png.h
